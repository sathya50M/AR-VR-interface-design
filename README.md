This project showcases a modern and immersive landing page concept for Augmented and Virtual Reality technology. The design highlights both AR and VR experiences through a clean and futuristic interface.

On the left side, the mockup demonstrates an AR feature, where users can view objects (like furniture) in their real environment using their mobile device.

On the right side, a VR experience is represented, showing a user wearing a VR headset ready to explore a virtual environment.

The dark gradient background with neon blue and purple tones creates a high-tech, immersive atmosphere.

Interactive buttons such as “Try in AR” and “Enter VR Mode” invite users to explore both technologies.

The layout is responsive, minimal, and visually balanced, ideal for tech companies or educational showcases related to AR/VR.
